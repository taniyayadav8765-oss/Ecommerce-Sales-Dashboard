# Ecommerce-Sales-Dashboard
I created this E-Commerce Sales Dashboard — from cleaning the data to analyzing, and visualizing it.
The dataset was cleaned in Excel, where I handled missing values, removed duplicates, and structured the data properly for analysis.

After that, I used Tableau to design an interactive dashboard that shows sales performance, Customer Performance, Day-wise Sales in a visually clear way.

This project helped me understand the end-to-end process of data analytics, from Cleaning to final business insights. It’s a reflection of my learning journey and how I turned simple data into something meaningful and actionable.

Tools Used:
Excel – Data cleaning and preparation
Tableau – Dashboard creation and data visualization
